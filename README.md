# Diblob

Diblob is a package designed for computations on digraphs (pseudographs).
The main assumption is to enable easy operations on JSON representations of digraphs. The package allows treating a subgraph as a node and facilitates the extraction of subgraphs for further work.
It is based on basic Python structures and does not depend on external packages.

# Installation
- The package can be installed with pip using the command pip install diblob.
- For installing packages necessary only for testing, use the command pip install -r requirements.txt.

# Data structure

The core of Diblob revolves around its data structure, managed by the GraphManager. Operations within Diblob are executed on Node, Edge, and Blob components.

## Node
Node representation in digraph. Components cosists of following fields:

Node representation in a digraph consists of the following fields:

- `node_id`: The identifier for the node used by GraphManager.
- `diblob_id`: The identifier of the diblob where the node is located.
- `incoming_nodes`: A list of node identifiers (tails of the edges for which the node is the head).
- `outgoing_nodes`: A list of node identifiers (heads of the edges for which the node is the tail).

Both incoming and outgoing nodes can be redundant, as pseudographs are accommodated as well.

## Edge
Representation of an edge in a digraph:
 - `path`: A list of node IDs that the edge connects.

## Diblob
Representation of a diblob within a digraph:
- `diblob_id`: The identifier for the diblob, used by GraphManager.
- `parent_id`: The identifier of the parent diblob to this diblob.
- `children`: IDs of diblobs that are children of this diblob.
- `nodes`: diblob IDs contained within this diblob.

Diblobs sharing the same graph form a tree-based structure. Furthermore, the entire graph is treated as a diblob (root_id).

## Examples

A digraph data structure can be created as follows:
```python
from diblob import DigraphManager

digraph_dict = {"B0": {"A": ["B", "F"],
                       "B": ["C", "D", "E"],
                       "C": ["D"],
                       "D": ["E", "F", "G"],
                       "E": ["F", "A"],
                       "F": ["G", "B"],
                       "G": ["A", "D"]}}

digraph_manager = DigraphManager(digraph_dict)
```
Note that if a digraph is stored in a JSON file, it can be loaded using json.load. 
To illustrate, let's create blobs B1 and B2 in the digraph, each containing specific nodes. 
Blob B1 will include nodes A and B, while B2 will encompass nodes C, D, and E:

```python
from diblob import tools

digraph_manager.gather('B1', {'A', 'B'})
digraph_manager.gather('B2', {'C', 'D', 'E'})

tools.display_digraph_json(digraph_manager('B0'))
```
The result is as follows (where display_digraph is a helper function used for printing a human-friendly output in Python):
```json
{
"B0": {
    "B1": {
        "B": [{"B2": ["C", "D", "E"]}],
        "A": ["B", {"B0": ["F"]}],
    },
    "B2": {
        "C": ["D"],
        "D": ["E", {"B0": ["F", "G"]}],
        "E": [{"B0": ["F"]}, {"B1": ["A"]}],
    },
    "F": ["G", {"B1": ["B"]}],
    "G": [{"B1": ["A"]}, {"B2": ["D"]}],
},
}
```
Now, let's compress the created diblobs into nodes:
```python
digraph_manager.compress_diblob('B1')
digraph_manager.compress_diblob('B2')

tools.display_digraph(digraph_manager('B0'))
```
The result is as follows:
```json
{
"B0": {
    "F": ["G", "B1"],
    "B2": ["F", "B1", "G", "F"],
    "B1": ["F", "B2", "B2", "B2"],
    "G": ["B1", "B2"],
},
}
```
# Diblob documentation
The Diblob package is composed of the following modules:

- `components`: Utilized by the Graph Manager, this module includes node, edge, and diblob components.
- `digraph_manager`: Serves as the core of the proposed data structure.
- `factory`: Provides examples of using the graph_manager for creating more complex digraphs.
- `algorithms`: Contains examples of employing Diblob with basic digraph algorithms such as DFS, DFSA (a modified version of DFS), and the Dijkstra algorithm.
- `exceptions`: Defines exceptions that are utilized across the modules.
- `tools`: Offers utilities for convenient work with digraphs.

Within the entire package, methods prefixed with an underscore ('_') are intended for internal use by the GraphManager.

# Components
Components are utilized by the GraphManager for the creation of the data structure, which consists of instances of the Node, Edge, and Diblob classes.

## Node
Node Representation in a Digraph:
Nodes in a digraph can have overlapping incoming and outgoing nodes, accommodating pseudographs as well.

### Fields
- `node_id`: The identifier of the node, used by GraphManager.
- `diblob_id`: The identifier of the diblob in which the node is located.
- `incoming_nodes`: A list of node IDs (tails of the edges for which this node is the head).
- `outgoing_nodes`: A list of node IDs (heads of the edges for which this node is the tail).
### Methods
- `get_incoming_edges(self)`: Returns a set of edge IDs where the node is the head.
- `get_outgoing_edges(self)`: Returns a set of edge IDs where the node is the tail.
- `incoming_dim(self)`: Returns the number of incoming nodes.
- `outgoing_dim(self)`: Returns the number of outgoing nodes.
- `_add_incoming(self, node_id: str)`: Adds a new node_id to incoming_nodes.
- `_add_outgoing(self, node_id: str)`: Adds a new node_id to outgoing_nodes.
- `_rm_incoming(self, node_id: str)`: Removes a node_id from incoming_nodes.
- `_rm_outgoing(self, node_id: str)`: Removes a node_id from outgoing_nodes.

## Edge
Edge Representation in a Digraph:
This representation allows for treating certain types of paths as a single edge, 
facilitating more efficient and simplified graph analyses.

### Fields

 - `path`: A list of node IDs that constitute the sequence of nodes this edge traverses.

The path is maintained as a list, enabling the treatment of a chain of node IDs as a single edge. 
This approach is particularly useful in operations like `compress_edges`, where multiple consecutive edges are consolidated into one for simplified graph representation.

<img width="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Zeleczek-kodowniczek/Diblob/assets/72871011/048eaba4-e8f2-4940-9312-c2edb72804b7">

### Methods
- `get_tail_and_head(self)`: Returns the tail and head nodes of the edge, indicating the direction of traversal.
- `get_id(self)`: Returns the edge_id, uniquely identifying the edge by its head and tail nodes.
- `_reverse(self)`: Reverses the order of nodes in the path field, effectively inverting the direction of the edge.
## Diblob

### Fields
Diblob Representation in a Digraph:

- `diblob_id`: The unique identifier for the diblob, utilized by GraphManager.
- `parent_id`: The identifier of the parent diblob, establishing a hierarchical relationship within the graph.
- `children`: A list of identifiers for diblobs that are children of this diblob, further defining the structure of the graph.
- `nodes`: A list of node IDs (or diblob IDs) that are contained within this diblob, representing the diblob's internal structure.

### Methods

- `_add_children(self, *child_ids: tuple[str])`: Adds one or more diblob_ids to the diblob, expanding its child elements.
- `_add_nodes(self, *node_ids: tuple[str])`: Incorporates one or more node_ids into the diblob, enhancing its internal structure.
# Digraph Manager
The Digraph Manager is at the heart of the package, overseeing the management of the data structure. It is crucial for the entire package's functionality. To create an instance of `DigraphManager`, a dictionary representation of the digraph is required, such as:
```python
digraph_dict = {
               "B0": {
                   "B1": {
                       "B": [{"B2": ["C", "D", "E"]}],
                       "A": ["B", {"B0": ["F"]}],
                   },
                   "B2": {
                       "C": ["D"],
                       "D": ["E", {"B0": ["F", "G"]}],
                       "E": [{"B0": ["F"]}, {"B1": ["A"]}],
                   },
                   "F": ["G", {"B1": ["B"]}],
                   "G": [{"B1": ["A"]}, {"B2": ["D"]}],
               },
               }

graph_manager = GraphManager(digraph_dict)
```
As a result, the following digraph has been created:

<img width="486" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Zeleczek-kodowniczek/Diblob/assets/72871011/72ecd1b0-d966-40be-96f3-80cbbcbbdaf0">

<img width="1075" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Zeleczek-kodowniczek/Diblob/assets/72871011/614e76e0-9a33-46d0-9439-397f29324d11">


- `decouple_edges(self)`: Transforms a pseudograph into a digraph by decoupling edges.

<img width="814" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Zeleczek-kodowniczek/Diblob/assets/72871011/23f69820-fcc8-4b44-880c-b92c49c521b3">

- `reverse_edges(self, *edges: tuple[Edge])`

<br /><br />  Reverses the direction of the specified edges within the digraph. This operation is performed on the edge objects themselves, rather than their node IDs.
- `sorted(self)`: Sorts all elements within the digraph structure, ensuring an orderly arrangement of nodes, edges, and possibly diblobs.
  
GraphManager has also magic methods which enables comfortable work on the structure:
- `__setitem__`: Enables working with structure in new methods:
  
```python
"""
Note that maintaining the structure is covered by other methods. __set_item__ is used just for methods implementation.
For instance digraph_manager[('A', 'B')] = AB not implies that nodes 'A' and 'B' are connected in structure.
Edge object is just registered by GraphManager.

If you want to create correct edge use connect_nodes method  on structure without Edge.
"""
  


digraph_dict = {"B0": {}}
digraph_manager = DigraphManager(digraph_dict)
 
A = Node(node_id='A', diblob_id='B0', incoming_nodes=[], outgoing_nodes=[])
B = Node(node_id='B', diblob_id='B0', incoming_nodes=[], outgoing_nodes=[])
B1 = Diblob(children={}, diblob_id='B1', nodes=['A', 'B'], parent_id='B0')
AB = Edge(['A', 'B'])
 
digraph_manager['A'] = A
digraph_manager['B'] = B
digraph_manager['B1'] = B1
digraph_manager[('A', 'B')] = AB
```

- `__get_item__`: Enables retrieval of an object using its registered ID. This method simplifies accessing nodes, edges, or diblobs directly by their identifiers.
- `__contains__`: Checks if a specific ID is registered within the graph. This can be particularly useful for verifying the presence of a node, edge, or diblob without directly accessing the item.
- `__call__`: Facilitates operations such as diblob extraction, making the GraphManager more versatile. For instance, the following code snippet demonstrates how to use this method:
```python
digraph_dict = {
                "B0": {
                    "B2": {
                        "E": [{"B0": ["F"]}, {"B1": ["A"]}],
                        "C": ["D"],
                        "D": ["E", {"B0": ["F", "G"]}],
                    },
                    "G": [{"B1": ["A"]}, {"B2": ["D"]}],
                    "F": ["G", {"B1": ["B"]}],
                    "B1": {
                        "B": [{"B2": ["C", "D", "E"]}],
                        "A": ["B", {"B0": ["F"]}],
                    },
                },
                }

digraph_manager = DigraphManager(digraph_dict)
tools.display_digraph(digraph_manager('B1'))

```
returns 

```json
{
"B1": {
    "B": [{"B2": ["C", "D", "E"]}],
    "A": ["B", {"B0": ["F"]}],
},
}
```
Please note that outgoing edges are preserved. To remove them, utilize the `cut_outgoing_edges` function available in the `tools` module.

# Factory 
The Factory is designed to facilitate the creation of various types of digraphs from a given input digraph. It operates independently from the GraphManager to ensure separation of concerns, as the GraphManager is dedicated to managing its internal graph structure.
<br><br>
Edge digraphs and Bipartite digraphs can only be created from digraphs that consist solely of root diblobs.

## methods:
- `generate_edge_digraph(digraph_manager: DigraphManager, reduce_value: int = 0, delimiter: str = '|')`
  - `digraph_manager: DigraphManager`: The DigraphManager instance that serves as the foundation for constructing the edge digraph.
  - `reduce_value: int`: Specifies the reduction value used as a numerical delimiter.
  - `delimiter: str`: The delimiter employed for creating node IDs derived from edges.
<br><br> Enables the creation of an edge digraph, where edges are transformed into nodes:
<img width="1022" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Zeleczek-kodowniczek/Diblob/assets/72871011/151e5f9b-35ee-4f43-8613-3c908880efd0">

In the example default `delimiter` and `reduce_value` was used. Delimiter add separator between node_ids during node_id creation in edge graph, reduce value enable cutting delimiter (for example if we use generate_edge_digraph second time in the graph on the right in the picture, we get for instance the node with node_id = `"A|C|C|B"` with default reduce value = 0, but `"A|C|B"` if reduce_value = 1 is set).

- `generate_bipartite_digraph(digraph_manager: DigraphManager)`
  - `digraph_manager: DigraphManager` - DigraphManager which is the base for bipartite digraph contruction.
 <br><br> enable bipartite digraph creation:

<img width="1028" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Zeleczek-kodowniczek/Diblob/assets/72871011/1f3a686e-c1ef-4a41-8fa2-58a67a83fd12">


## Aghoritms
In order to working with diblob explanation, DFS, DFSA and Dijkstra algorithms are created. 

- DFS - Deep first search alghoritm.
- DFSA - modification of the DFS (with the nodes visit time)
- DijkstraAlgorithm - the shortes paths between node and the others.

Alghoritms use duck typing. GraphManager instance have to be delivered during creation. Then `run` methon can be used on selected node_id (in DijkstraAlgorithm `cost_function` as a dict can be also delivered)

Example of run:

 <br><br>
```python
from diblob import DigraphManager
from diblob.algorithms import DFS, DFSA, DijkstraAlgorithm

digraph_dict = {"B0": {"A": ["B", "F"],
                       "B": ["C", "D", "E"],
                       "C": ["D"],
                       "D": ["E", "F", "G"],
                       "E": ["F", "A"],
                       "F": ["G", "B"],
                       "G": ["A", "D"]}}

digraph_manager = DigraphManager(digraph_dict)

dfs = DFS(digraph_manager)
dfsa = DFSA(digraph_manager)
da = DijkstraAlgorithm(digraph_manager)

dfs.run('A')
dfsa.run('B')
da.run('C')
```
## Tools
Tools for diblob which are used for user friendly printing or cutting nodes in json.
Tools deliver following functions:
- `display_digraph(d: dict, indent=0)`: Enables printing dict in json format (work as print).
- `cut_outgoing_edges(digraph_manager, diblob_id: str)`: Cuts outgoing nodes of the Digraph (can be used with GraphManager `__call__`)
- `sort_outgoing_nodes_in_dict_repr(node_lst: list)`: Sorts outgoing nodes.
<br> Example: `['C', 'B', 'A', {'G1': ['A', 'C', 'B']}] -> ['A', 'B', 'C', {'G1': ['A', 'B', 'C']}]`
- `list_groupby`: Works like groupby from itertools (no need data to be sorted).
